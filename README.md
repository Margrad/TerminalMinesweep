# TerminalMinesweep
A verion of Minesweep on a terminal writen in VisualStudios C++

This is just an version of the old Windows game "Minesweep" that I wrote just as an exercise.
I still have to add 1 key functionality:
 - When digging a non mine or next to a mine plot it should dig all surrounding non-mine or non-next-to-mine.
